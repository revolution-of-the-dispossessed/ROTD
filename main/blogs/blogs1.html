This is the last time I'm fucking with neocities, I swear to fucking god dude. They can't fucking touch me here.
    Nobody can. I can do whatever I want and there's nothing anyone can do to stop me!!! FUCK CENSORSHIP OF THE NET!
    I'm going to be continuing my shit here and this will be a neat little place to keep things until I secure the
    domain name. Luckily I saved all my codes and templates and images and whatnot and I had barely begun the
    research process before they fucked me again.

<p>
This website will forever be a shrine to those who stood against the overseers that uphold this bullshit hegemony. HAIL SATAN!!!

I'm just going to use my visualization skills to code this shit perfect so that by the time it's all done I can just upload it anywhere lmfao.
     Fuck the rest. No one can even see this right now as I'm typing and updating it. Too many requests have gone into this shitty fucking 
    third-party hosting website. But whatever... people will see it eventually lmfao. Consider this blog my descent into depravity, my
    manifesto (as all the LARPER faggots are calling it lol...)
</p>
    <p>Anyways! Whenever anyone sees this shit I hope they think it's cool. I worked really fucking hard on it and I'm tired of doing this 
        whole stream of consciousness bullshit everytime I have to restart. This is so much more taxing than getting termed on social media 
        or tumblr or whatever. Like sure it sucks not having contact with the people I grew up with or anyone who I became online friends 
        with, but eh. I'd prefer to just have my fucking website dude. I just want to have my own corner of the fucking internet to say and 
        post whatever the fuck I want. There's nothing wrong with providing historical and psychological information associated with tragic 
        events. I will NOT be silenced!!!!

<p>
Whatever. I will try to stop yapping I guess and maybe post on tumbles here and there. Thanks to whoever is sticking with me through this
    bullshit.
