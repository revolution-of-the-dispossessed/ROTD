            <h2>Crime</h2>
            <p>At the time of the attack, Professor Thomas F. Parkinson, a respected English scholar, was meeting with graduate student Stephen M. Thomas in his office. Farmer confronted them directly and fired his weapon. The blast killed Thomas instantly, while Parkinson was seriously injured, sustaining lasting damage to his body and face. The attack was brief but brutal, leaving the campus community in shock.

Police arrived quickly and apprehended Farmer without further incident. Unlike some later school shootings, he had not acted randomly; his attack was calculated and targeted, reflecting both his ideological fixation and underlying mental instability.</p>

            <h2>Victims</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Stephen M. Thomas — 19,</b> killed by a gunshot during the attack</li>
              <li><b>Thomas F. Parkinson,</b> survived but sustained major wounds, including vertebra damage and lasting disfigurement.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Motive</h2>
            <p>Farmer’s stated motivation was ideological — he compiled a list of people he thought were linked to communism
              or “liberal” causes, reflective of intense Cold War and McCarthy‑era anxieties. The violence was pre–
              Free Speech Movement and pre–Vietnam War protest era, but it occurred in a period of political tension
              on campus and nationwide.</p>

            <h2>Reputation</h2>
            <p>Farmer was described as quiet and reserved, but very passionate about social and political issues. Post-incident analysis indicated 
              signs of paranoid ideation, possible delusional thinking, and an obsessive focus on ideological enemies, but these were diagnosed 
              after the shooting.</p>

            <h2>Gear</h2>
          <b>Winchester Model 12 (12 Gauge)</b>

<p>
  The <strong>Winchester Model 12</strong> is a legendary American
  <strong>pump-action shotgun</strong> introduced in 1912.
  By the early 1960s, it was one of the most common sporting shotguns
  in Northern California, especially for duck hunting and upland game.
</p>

<h3>Basic Specs</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Gauge:</strong> 12, 16, 20, 28, .410 (12 gauge most common)</li>
  <li><strong>Action:</strong> Pump-action</li>
  <li><strong>Magazine:</strong> Tubular (4+1 typical)</li>
  <li><strong>Barrel length:</strong> 26" – 30"</li>
  <li><strong>Weight:</strong> ~7.5 lbs</li>
  <li><strong>Stock:</strong> Walnut wood</li>
  <li><strong>Receiver:</strong> Steel</li>
  <li><strong>Sights:</strong> Front bead</li>
  <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Cross-bolt</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why It Was Popular</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Extremely smooth pump action</li>
  <li>Very durable and well-made</li>
  <li>Common for waterfowl hunting</li>
  <li>Trusted by generations of hunters</li>
</ul>

<p class="note">
  The Model 12 was a civilian sporting shotgun, not a military weapon.
</p>

            <h2>Upbringing</h2>
            <p>Nothing about his childhood is known except for the fact that he was born in Alameda, California.</p>

            <h2>Aftermath</h2>
            <p>Aside from the limited records of this case, there is no arrest or trial that follows this event. The 
              incident was covered in local and regional press at the time, with reports emphasizing the attack in a campus
              office and the ideological motivations implied by Farmer’s notes and list. Coverage focused on the shock of 
              violence at a prestigious university, the vulnerability of faculty in their offices, and the broader climate 
              of suspicion associated with anti‑communist sentiment.</p>

            <p>Initially, colleagues described him as intelligent and well-qualified, but his behavior became
                more erratic after promotion, leading to workplace tensions. Spencer’s coworkers described him
                as a perfectionist with a volatile temperament. Tensions grew after he was placed on an involuntary
                leave of absence in 1939 due to nervous breakdowns and severe headaches. By 1940, after his
                suspension, he became fixated on a meeting to discuss his job status — and instead brought his gun.</p>
            <p>He suffered from chronic headaches and apparently began taking high doses of bromide (a then-common
                sedative) that later was shown to have had a significant effect on his mental state at the time of the shootings.
            He was reported to be an avid gun enthusiast, often carrying a pistol in his car and practicing shooting regularly.</p>

    The <strong>Colt Woodsman</strong> is a classic American
    <strong>.22-caliber semi-automatic pistol</strong> introduced in 1915.
    It was mainly used for target shooting, training, and small-game hunting.
  </p>

  <h3>Basic Specs</h3>

    <li><strong>Caliber:</strong> .22 Long Rifle</li>
    <li><strong>Action:</strong> Semi-automatic (blowback)</li>

            <h2>Upbringing</h2>
            <p>His parents divorced at an unspecified time when he was young. There aren’t extensive records of
                his childhood or early schooling publicly available online — typical for someone from that era
                who wasn’t famous until a criminal act — but we do have some details about his education and
                adult life that shed light on his background. He graduated from Colorado State Teachers College
                in Greeley in 1925, earning a master’s degree from Stanford University in 1932.</p>
            <p>Spencer worked for several years in the Ventura, California school district and moved to South
                Pasadena in 1933 with his wife, Mildred “Polly” Pollock, whom he married in 1931.</p>

            <h2>Aftermath</h2>
            <p>Spencer plead guilty to 5 counts of first-degree murder and 1 count of attempted murder. He was
            sentenced to 5 consecutive life sentences. He served 30 years in prison and was paroled, going to live in
            Hawaii where he lived quietly and helped former inmates reintegrate. He died at age 88.</p>
            <p>Major papers like the Los Angeles Times and New York Times covered it extensively. What shocked people
            the most was that he was the school's principal. He targeted colleagues, not random students. Narratives
            pushed by the media focused on his mental state, but not so much about gun access. This case did, however,
            become a reference point whenever school violence was discussed for decades afterward.</p>
            <p>Schools shut down temporarily, memorials were held, and teachers feared going to work. There was
            increased security presence on school grounds and tightened employee evaluations, but there was no public
            safety infrastructure like today.</p>
