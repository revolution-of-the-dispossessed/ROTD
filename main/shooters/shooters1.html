            <p>One day in April of 1891, an elderly man decided to open fire on a playground.</p>

            <p>Local newspapers such as the Charleston Gazette and Bluefield Daily Telegraph reported the shooting.
                Coverage focused on the shock of a school attack, the death of the teacher, and Hill’s suicide.
            Despite Hill being white, Reports did not explore racial or disability issues deeply; the school being
                for Black and disabled students was mentioned but largely as a secondary fact.</p>
            <p>No documented new laws were passed in West Virginia or federally as a direct result of this shooting.
                1930s America had limited public discourse on school shootings; most incidents were treated as

            <p>Spencer opened fire on multiple school staff members after he was suspended from his job as
                a junior high school principal and called to a meeting to discuss his dismissal.</p>

            <h2>Motive</h2>
            <p>Initially, colleagues described him as intelligent and well-qualified, but his behavior became
                more erratic after promotion, leading to workplace tensions.Spencer’s coworkers described him
                as a perfectionist with a volatile temperament. Tensions grew after he was placed on an involuntary
                leave of absence in 1939 due to nervous breakdowns and severe headaches. By 1940, after his
                suspension, he became fixated on a meeting to discuss his job status — and instead brought his gun.</p>

            <h2>Upbringing</h2>
            <p>His parents divorced at an unspecified time when he was young. There aren’t extensive records of
                his childhood or early schooling publicly available online — typical for someone from that era
                who wasn’t famous until a criminal act — but we do have some details about his education and
                adult life that shed light on his background. He graduated from Colorado State Teachers College
                in Greeley in 1925, earning a master’s degree from Stanford University in 1932.</p>
            <p>Spencer worked for several years in the Ventura, California school district and moved to South
                Pasadena in 1933 with his wife, Mildred “Polly” Pollock, whom he married in 1931.</p>
